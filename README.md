# New York Times Article

> This project required us to utilize many different CSS techniques to get it looking similar to the original. The article was pretty straight-forward but was a bit tricky when it came to the images that were wider than the article text. The footer was more time-consuming as it required us to use CSS Grid and try out different configurations. Overall it was a good learning experience and pushed us to use techniques that we hadn't tried before.
